Published in Watson, J., Hughes, J., Iida F. (2017) Real-World, Real-Time Robotic Grasping with Convolutional Neural Networks
In 18th Towards Autonomous Robotic Systems (TAROS) Conference

Uses
* ROS
* Caffe
* OpenCV

This code was pushed after an intense 16 week Master's thesis project. More work should have been done to improve the codebase for general use, but here it is at least a record of the implementation.
